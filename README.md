Project Overview: Interactive Quiz Application
The Interactive Quiz Application is a web-based quiz that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, receive immediate feedback, and see their total score at the end of the quiz. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application handles multiple-choice questions, tracks user responses, calculates the score, and dynamically updates the interface with results. This project demonstrates core web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple state management in JavaScript

Key Features:
1.Question Navigation: Users are presented with one question at a time, and they can select an answer before moving to the next question.
2.Answer Validation: The application checks whether the selected answer is correct and updates the score accordingly.
3.Dynamic Interface: The quiz interface updates in real-time as users progress through the questions.
4.Final Score Display: After completing the quiz, the userâ€™s total score is displayed, along with an option to retake the quiz.
5.Responsive Design: The app uses basic CSS to ensure a user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Defines the structure of the quiz, including question and answer elements, buttons, and layout.
CSS: Styles the layout, ensuring the quiz looks clean, modern, and user-friendly. It also makes the app responsive across different devices.
JavaScript: Handles the quiz logic, such as loading questions, checking answers, updating scores, and dynamically rendering results.
